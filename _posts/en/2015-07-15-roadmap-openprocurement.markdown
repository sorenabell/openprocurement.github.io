####COMING SOON

##[Test Stand with Automated Acceptance Test Suite](http://openprocurement.org/en/test-stand.html)

##Multi-lot tender
* Opportunity to divide the procurement procedure into parts - lots.
* Automatic uniformity verification of the procurement subject for all lots and all nomenclatures of the tender.
* Compatibility with lot-less procedures (for eMalls that do not support multi-lot tenders).

##Complaints
* To implement the complaint mechanism for the below-threshold tenders via Complaint Review body at Transparency International Ukraine or another independent public organization that can make recommendations for Procuring entities.
* To implement the complaint mechanism for the above-threshold tenders according to the articles 18 and 23 of the law on Public procurement.

####PLANNED

##Dynamic Purchasing System
* Applied for commonly used purchases the characteristics of which, as generally available on the market, meet their requirements.
* Set up and manage end-to-end dynamic purchasing systems which can be divided into categories of works, services and goods. 

##New Features
* Integration with Tender Electronic Daily (TED).
* Multi-lot purchases.

####FUTURE

##[Public Procurement Portal](http://openprocurement.org/en/public-procurement-portal)
* Discoverability via search engines, permalinks, notification subscription, data visualization. 
* Search criteria and filtering (based on Economic Operator, range of dates, CPV code, etc.).
* Data in several different open formats (OCDS, CSV, SPARQL, XML, etc.).

##Operation mechanism via “version window”
* Smoother transition from the older API version to the newer one. 
* eMalls do not need to synchronize the transition time, each eMall can upgrade separately.
* CDB can be accessed via both older and newer versions.

##e-Contracting module
* Maintaining and retrieving up-to-date information regarding contracts.
* e-Invoicing.
* Registering and tracking of contract and its changes.
* Tracking of the contract implementation stages.
* Contract closure.

##e-Planning 
* Collecting and displaying data about public procurement plans of all Economic Operators.

##Document Management
* Registering, filing, archiving and logging activity on the decrypted human readable version of the tender bundle.
* Long-term preservations of documents in digitised format, ensuring that they can be easily retrieved without conversions.

##Business Intelligence module
* Extract all necessary data to perform procurement statistical analysis from CDB.
* Statistical analysis of procurement data plays a significant role in the strategy definition for future procurement expenditures and serves as a strategic tool for the whole electronic procurement lifecycle.

##Business Certification/Prequalification Management
* Economic Operators can prequalify and certify contractors.
* Manage, maintain and retrieve up-to-date information on vendors.
* Automatic renewal notifications.

##RFP Evaluation
* Assign evaluators, set evaluation criteria, build scoring measures.
* Check technical qualifications prior to proposal evaluation.
* Receive comprehensive reports and charts.
